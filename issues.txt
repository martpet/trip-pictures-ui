- Chrome, Firefox don't convert heic to jpeg when input file accept is "image/jpeg"

- converting heic with heic2any is slow

- heic2any doesn't copy exif data

- cannot rotate jpeg with "@ginpei/exif-orientation" when missing exif data (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207088)

- exif is lost when uploading from iphone library with photos taken with 'high efficency' setting

- unused css from adobe spectrum in bundle

- cannot render via portal outside of Spectrum provider (needed for AppLoder zIndex over Dialog) (https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues/1697)
